Twifire uses a system known as bitflags to store what admin commands a player has
This means that admin accounts, if read in binary, would look like
1 0 0 1
a a a a
m m m m
k s b s
i l a l
c a n e
k p   e
      p
and so on for every command.
However, if read as a text file, it'll just be a massive number.
This number is the result of adding together the powernumbers of all the commands in any given group that you want to have
For example, amkick is group 1 powernumber 8, and amban is group 1 powernumber 16
So you simply add 8+16 and then you set group1 powers to 24, and you will have amkick and amban

All commands, with powernumbers, are listed in the readme 'command list with powers'


You can calculate these numbers with twifire/helpfiles/calculator.exe
- Or now with twifire/helpfiles/TwifireAccountEditor.exe
