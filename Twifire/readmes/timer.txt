the 'DateGetTime.exe' and 'time.dat' files
are there for the lastlogintime, and the current time system
if you want to use the timer system, just run DateTimeGet.exe,
but it isn't required.
But don't delete the time.dat - the server expects it to be there and readable.


If you want to create your own timer system:
time.dat needs to be continually updated with the current date in any format you wish
Note that the server reads time.dat for changes every 60 seconds


This is needed because:
JK2 has no internal way to get the current time, so we must use an external method- a running program updating a file that the server can then read.




Note: DateTimeGet system requirements: Windows operating system with .Net framework 4.0
