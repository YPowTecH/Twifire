twifire_default_weaps.cfg
is a script that is executed when the command /amdefaultweapons is used
it has all the settings for custom weapons
you can fill it with whatever settings you want or server commands.


admin_def_*.cfg files
are used for /ammakeadmin (A grouped version of amgivecommand)
they contain power (see readme 'powers') settings to be given to an account
To edit them, I recommend using HelpFiles/TwifireAccountEditor (see relevant readme)
OR use notepad++ http://notepad-plus-plus.org/


admin_def_unholy.cfg
is the settings used by 'admin' account. It has every command.


It is recommended you create an admin_def_*.cfg file for all of your preferred admin ranks
Though 'unholy' works quite well as the highest-level admin settings.

File format:
powers1
powers2
powers3
powers4
powers5
powers6
powers7
BlankLine



admin_free.cfg
is what commands all registered users get. In the format:
"mcfreeadmin" powers1 power2 powers3 powers4 powers5 powers6 powers7



credits.cfg
is the settings for the credit system - it's just a script.
