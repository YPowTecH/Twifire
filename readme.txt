FILENAME: Twifirev1096Beta.zip
FILESIZE: 1 MB
DATE RELEASED: April 9th, 2013


CREDITS: Twifire was primarily made by mcmonkey, with some code used from Twitch (Twimod) and DeathSpike (DS-Online) and some help from Daggolin


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Extract the .zip file using winzip or 7-zip, copy the folder named 'Twifire' into your Gamedata folder, follow other included readmes inside folder for further instructions.
-IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot launch Twifire from the in-game menus, you must launch it as a dedicated server (using .bat scripts) 
-ALSO: Twifire requires a higher com_hunkmegs settings. As do most maps. It's best to always have com_hunkmegs at 128 or higher, even when not using Twifire or large maps.


DESCRIPTION: Twifire mod is intended to be the final server mod, with anything and everything you could need
From launching TIE fighters at your enemies to rapid fire super rocket launchers or maybe just flying around on a jetpack or in an X-Wing, there's nothing you can't do in Twifire.
Twifire's most notable addition is fully working and fully powered in-game Map editing. Want to add a chair in the corner? Go ahead. Want to light a fire? Go ahead. Want to make it move when players get near it? Go ahead. You can do anything with just a little work. Players digging through the commands might even find my unfinished 'Minecraft' mode.
Remember, if this seems like too much to you, you can change a few options and the server isn't any different from a BaseJK server.
Twifire also features tons of security systems to keep your server running online securely. No more angry hackers taking down your server.
Twifire also can automatically restore some of the default singleplayer maps. (Some, not all)
This mod requires no client downloads.
-- Yes, we have FullForce duels and jetpacks and all that silliness.

BUGS: None known. Please report any to me, mcmonkey - via the methods listed at http://mcmonkey4eva.dyndns.org/contact (or above)
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PROFESSIONAL HOSTING - some professional hosts limit your com_hunkmegs to 32 - THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH TWIFIRE (or any custom maps). You must purchase a higher amount!

COMMENTS: Note that there is a 'Twifire v900' floating around: That is not this. It is inferior and full of bugs and security holes. Do not use it.
